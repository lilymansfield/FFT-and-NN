# PHYS 250 Assignment 5: Fast Fourier Transforms and Neural Networks

## Assignment

1. Analyze LIGO data as a waveform and apply FFT techniques that we've discussed to attempt to filter a real signal and compare to expectations.
2. Write a single "perceptron" and analyze its ability to model a simple logic gate.

## Logistics

As we've been discussing in lectures, both fast *Fourier transforms* and *neural networks* are tools to help in filtering, studying, and fitting data of various forms and are nearly ubiquitous in physics research. 

In this assignment, by request, we will consider *both* sets of tools. *Please attempt to complete both parts, although the grade for the assignment will be based on the highest grade for each of the parts, or the sum of the two, which ever is largest*. (Meaning, you could do a great job on just one part, or make a serious attempt at both and still get full credit).

## Introduction

Two of the goals of this course, as we discussed on Day 1, are:

* Identify models that benefit from or require computational/numerical approaches and tools to either develop and understand or to evalaute.
* Build familiarity with common computational models and algorithms and numerical approaches to typical problems.

Fast Fourier Transforms and Neural Networks address both of these goals and are exceedingly common computational tools and techniques in physics.
